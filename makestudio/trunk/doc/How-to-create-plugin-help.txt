All Plugins have to provide a Microsoft HTML Help file (.chm)
This file has to be distributet to <makestudio install dir>\help

Every new .chm File will autmatically be merged into the main 
helpfile of MakeStudio
If your help file should start a new chapter in the main help, 
you have to add an additional .txt file with the following content:
chapter=<mychapter>

See .\doc\help\example

Our current help-creation-software is "Help and Manual 6"
